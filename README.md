# Online-Bookstore
A web application simulating an online e-bookstore for viewing, cataloging, managing and browsing items for staff/customer users. Backend: PHP, MySQL. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JQuery. 

This was a course project for a Database class, and this repo is complete with an informal requirements documentation, EER diagrams, EER-to-Relational database schema diagrams, complete MySQL statements and all html/css front end modules and php backend modules. Project is mostly complete except for sprucing up some stray ends for a more presentable finish.

# Future Work

1. Fix UI issue in the forms section.
2. Integrate user log in sessions. Recognize when customer vs staff.
3. Include a cart system for storing items pre-purchase.
4. Fix unsecure SQL statements from injection attacks.
5. Figure out a smarter way to include the nav bar in every php file without raw copy-pasting.
6. Make better front-end design overall (with a cover page and all that glam).
